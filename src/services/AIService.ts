Hi Team,

I was looking for a ${industry} in ${city} today and clicked onto your website. I noticed that Google Chrome is displaying a prominent "Not Secure" warning next to your domain.

This usually happens when an SSL certificate is missing or expired. It causes a lot of potential customers to bounce because they're worried about inputting their details. 

We specialize in helping local businesses in ${city} secure and speed up their websites. It usually takes less than 48 hours to resolve.

Would you be open to a quick call tomorrow to see how we can get this fixed for you?
